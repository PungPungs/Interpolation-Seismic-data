# Interpolation-Seismic-data
This project uses a ML system to interpolation seismic data. Maybe It's a very long project. Beacuse I'll also planning to create seg-y program just for me

# CHATER 1
 - I majored computer engineering but i want to create seg-y program. because our company is  ocean exploration company and we have a lot of segy file. My ultimate goal is to save  my company staff  time by interpolating seismic data
 - First, we will create a seg-y configuration file and then proceed with optimization. I want to use a low-level programming language, but I don't have the skills to do so. So I'm thinking of giving it a try once I'm done with this project and have enough time to optimize it.
